# Q1:  Rewrite the 2_tensor_pytorch file in our notation and find out what are the
# differences. Find out which was easier to follow?.

# Q2:  Use the time package python library on 1_Numpy and 2_Tensor_Pytorch files. To find out
# numpy is faster or torch tensor. Keep the same data size and change the number of epochs.
#  Check your results ans see does it make sense.
